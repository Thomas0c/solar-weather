## About the project
The project is a side-project built and maintained at night. It started as an exploration of React Native, Realm and Redux and has now found it's place on my home screen. I designed the application in Fall 2016, then built a prototype, and recently decided to try to build an actual working version that could not only benefit myself, but also others.
